## Express

The course is a basic introduction to express and how to handle back-end development using this module to boost productivity.

## 1st Module
Basic introduction to networking protocols as TCP, UDP and the TCP/IP. The instructor tells the difference and how both protocols handles data and for which purpouse they work better.

## Introduction to Node.js
As the instructor says, this is not a Node.js course to show you all fancy stuff nodejs can handle, but to focus on what express can help you when programming with node.js.
Funny, I've always seen node.js as a framework but the instructor says it is programming language. 

Still he gives a brief but worth introduction of why express was built and how it helps us getting started faster and focus on what really matters to developers.
The code of this section is in nodeServer.js file.

## Express
After a creating a server on pure node, now it is time to see how express does the same thing but hopefully easier.

Every video of the this section is showing the same thing of the previous section but on how express handles.

* Shows the creation of the server
* Shows how routing is handled
* Shows how static assets are served
